Scenario
You are hired as a Data Analyst in a heavy mining company.

Management wants to implement a Predictive Maintenance System to reduce:
Unexpected machine breakdown
Production downtime
Safety risks
Maintenance cost

Before Data Scientists build models, your task is:
Audit, analyze, and prepare the industrial sensor dataset for ML deployment.
You are responsible for data quality, reliability, and industrial risk interpretation.

PHASE 1 — Data Audit & Risk Evaluation (Industrial Thinking)
Task 1: Data Integrity Check
    1. Check missing values.
    2. Detect impossible values (domain reasoning):
        Negative torque?
        Temperature outside physical range?
    3. Check duplicated records.
    4. Check inconsistent failure flags.
Question:
    If this data feeds a real-time control system, what risks exist?
Deliverable:
    Short industrial audit summary (5–7 bullet points).

PHASE 2 — Sensor Behavior Analysis
You must treat each variable as a real industrial sensor.
For each numeric feature:
    1. Analyze distribution.
    2. Compute dispersion (std, IQR).
    3. Identify extreme operating zones.
    4. Compare sensor behavior for:
        Normal machines
        Failed machines
Questions:
    Which sensors behave differently before failure?
    Which variables may be early warning signals?
Deliverable:
    Table + interpretation paragraph.

PHASE 3 — Industrial Anomaly Detection
Instead of just removing outliers:
    1. Detect anomalies using:
        Z-score
        IQR
    2. Compare anomaly records with failure label.
Questions:
    Are anomalies noise or early breakdown signals?
    Should we remove them or mark them as risk indicators?
Deliverable:
    Decision with justification.

PHASE 4 — Risk Segmentation (Business-Oriented)
Create industrial risk zones.
Examples:
    Tool wear:
        0–100 → Normal
        100–200 → Maintenance soon
        200+ → Critical
    Temperature difference (Process – Air):
        Small → Stable
        Medium → Warning
        Large → Overheating risk
    Then:
        1. Create risk categories.
        2. Calculate failure rate per risk zone.
Question:
    Does risk segmentation meaningfully separate failure probability?
Deliverable:
    Risk segmentation table + chart.

PHASE 5 — Data Preparation for Production
1. Apply scaling (justify choice).
2. Check class imbalance.
3. Apply 30% sampling.
4. Compare sample vs full dataset statistics.
Question:
    If this dataset is used for model training, what bias risks exist?
